    <h2>This chicken piccata recipe is quick and easy</h2>
    Pounded chicken breasts are topped with a simple pan sauce made with capers,
    butter, white wine, and lemon juice.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 Â½ tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid,
        level surface. Firmly pound chicken breasts with the smooth<br />
        side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black
        pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the
        pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned<br />
        and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to 2
        minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
